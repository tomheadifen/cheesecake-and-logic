# Deploying Vuepress with no backend code!
One of the things that drew me to trying vue press is that it's a static site builder.  As a developer writing code isn't that big of a deal so setting up a deployment script to deploy the site whenever I make changes means tha I no longer need to maintain any sort of authenticaion logic which then means I don't have to care about security at all! Yay!
